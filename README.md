 ## Objective
 * To create a simple online storefront, fully conforming to a provided client specification. This will involve the use of supporting tools, methodologies and technologies that encapsulate all modules covered during training.
This project has the following requirements:


## Jira board
I initially began this project by outlining my plans for an online store specializing in books. To effectively monitor my project's development, I established a Kanban board. Within this board, I created a backlog column containing user stories of the customer and the owner outlining their preferences and desires for the website's functionality.
User/Customer stories:
'As a customer I want to :
* Add products to my cart
* be notified of the order being placed
* to securely enter my payment details
* Adjust the quantity of the products
* Able to view product details, stock levels and descritption 
* Easily enter my billing and shipping information
* want to shop by category
* navigate other section of the site
* see the total price of my cart
* see an about us page to access the store information on purpose or mission.
As a store owner I want:
* Monitor and access the databases

## ERD/EER
I started by creating a basic entity relationship diagram to outline the expected connections between different entities. I expected that I would only need two tables where in the stored details of the customer, I expected information of customer book purchases as well through the db relationship. This is what it initially looked like:

As my project advanced, I came to understand that the initial approach was quite complex and wouldn't have been effective for storing customer information alongside the corresponding book IDs they bought. To address this, I introduced a third table named "Purchase," which includes the customer ID and the book ISBN. This new table establishes a relationship between the book and customer tables. Ultimately, the outcome shifted from associating customer IDs with book ISBNs to associating customer IDs with book names.
This is the final look:

## Checkout/Payment page  
To begin, I initiated the process of crafting the application routes intended for the checkout and payment pages. This entailed importing the essential Flask modules to enable their functionality. In a distinct file, I generated dedicated Flask forms for both the Payment and checkout segments. These forms were equipped with validators aimed at verifying that user-input data adhered to specific prerequisites. Following this, I proceeded to implement HTML code to visually render the form fields seamlessly on the webpage.

On the submit button action, I implemented the process so that when it's clicked, the provided information is stored in the customer table during the checkout 
On the payment page, I made certain that when the customer proceeds with the checkout, they are redirected to the home page. Additionally, a notification is displayed to inform the customer that their order has been successfully placed. 

## Create SQL Database

By employing imports from SQLAlchemy and sqlalchemy.orm within Flask, I've been able to establish the database tables for Books, Customer, and Purchases. I utilized app configuration to establish a connection with my local MySQL database. In a distinct file, I integrated the database for the 'books' table, along with the database session and commit functionality.

## Product page 
After setting up the 'books' database, I extracted the information about the available books and incorporated it into my product page. In the HTML code, I employed a loop to iterate through the book list, enabling the display of each book in the product section.  After showcasing the books on the product page, I proceeded to create individual routes for each book item. This ensured that each book had its dedicated page, with  more detailed descriptions and information about each book.

## cart page 
 Within the cart functionality, I introduced a new list named "serialized_cart." This list was generated by iterating through each item present in the cart. For each item, a dictionary was created, encompassing details such as its name, quantity, and price.Additionally, the overall total price of the items in the cart was also taken into account.

## Products category:
I developed a dropdown menu that showcases books categorized by their respective genres, such as fiction, non-fiction, and more. The books displayed in this dropdown menu are tailored to each genre. Additionally, each book listed in the dropdown menu is linked directly to its dedicated page, providing a seamless transition to the detailed information about the selected book.
## home page/about and about page
On my homepage, I've incorporated a slideshow featuring images related to books and accompanied by quotes, creating an interactive and captivating experience. Additionally, I've included navigation bars that enable customers to explore various other sections of the website.

In the "About" page, I've made sure to articulate the mission of Bookish Nooks and outline our core values. Lastly, the "Contact" page provides customers with the necessary details to reach out to me. I've also offered the convenience of a contact form as an alternative means of communication.

##Testing with pytest and jenkins

I produced a file named test_app.py, in which I developed unit tests to assess different functionalities of a Flask-based web application framework. Upon executing these tests using Jenkins, an error emerged indicating a failure to establish a connection with my local MySQL server. Subsequently, I adjusted the application configuration to use SQLite instead. Despite this alteration, the same error persisted. Although this situation is unfortunate, it's worth noting that when I ran the pytest within Visual Studio Code, all tests successfully passed.

## Reflection/Improvement 
Examining this project, it has provided me with genuine insight into the demands of development work under tight time constraints. This endeavor has not only granted me this valuable exposure, but it has also enabled me to refine my approach to solving the numerous errors that arise during code execution. Although some issues may require extended periods to resolve, I have made progress in comprehending syntax intricacies and error codes. With the prospect of engaging in another project, I anticipate further enhancing my coding proficiency.

Upon reviewing my project, I recognize several avenues for improvement. One area involves incorporating a cart summary into the payment pageâ€”an undertaking I would readily embrace if granted more time. While my overall design could have been more sophisticated, I am presently in the process of familiarizing myself with HTML and CSS. Furthermore, there's room for augmenting functionalities, such as introducing delete or remove buttons within the cart basket. I intend to bear these considerations in mind and endeavor to apply them in practice.

## Acknowlegements
The majority of my gratitude is directed towards Earl Gray, whose extensive instruction, guidance, and clarifications were instrumental whenever I faced confusion or uncertainty about requirements. I'd also like to express my appreciation to W3Schools for their valuable resources on Bootstrap and slideshow creation, enabling me to craft my website. Additionally, I owe thanks to Stack Overflow, as it played a pivotal role in helping me comprehend and resolve various issues I encountered.
